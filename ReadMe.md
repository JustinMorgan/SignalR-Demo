##SignalR DevSession, 2014-07-30

This repo contains demo code and PowerPoint slides for my DevSession on SignalR. The code was partly built on the "ASP.NET MVC5 with Bootstrap 3.1.1 LESS" template available online, and contains a few drop-ins, including:

- Angular.js
- Twitter Bootstrap
- LESS
- A small MVC5 REST API

There are two main demo apps: Blocks and Feeds. 

- Blocks is a simple real-time block-dragging app implemented in both the Hub and Persistent Connection styles. 
- Feeds is a more involved application that simulates multiple users posting to the same feed at once. It uses Angular, Bootstrap, LESS, and wraps SignalR in a familiar jQuery-style event-handling pattern.
